            <h2>A Few Things About Me</h2>
            <p>I have two awesome kids at home, a 12 year old daughter and 13 year old son whom I have probably shown entirely
                too many zombie movies. Some of my favorite books are Dune, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and War and
                Peace. I love Thundercats, Star Wars, Robot Chicken, and documentaries. I love cooking, and not cooking.
                I have a deep hatred for autocorrect and autotune.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I started messing around with computers when I was about 13 (I was a DOS baby), by 16 I had begun to teach myself
                some HTML and javaScript, but that went by the wayside after entering the workforce. I'm originally from
                Shreveport, LA but I grew up half of my life in Memphis, TN where I currently live with my kids. I spent
                14 years in Colorado and I can't wait to get back. I'm hoping to find something out there in Web Development
                upon completing coding boot camp.</p>

            <h2>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h2>
            <p>Mostly because I love making things, especially things that work and do stuff. I started learning again after
                just moving back to Tennessee to help my father and his wife after a series of medical complications. I found
                myself looking for a decent job much longer than I thought I would, so I put my spare time to use and decided
                to pursue an education in web development.</p>
